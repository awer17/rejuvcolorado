    <p>Although over-the-county beauty products and medical-grade skincare are often intended for treating the same concerns, medical-grade products are prescribed by doctors or licensed aestheticians. The formulas in medical-grade skincare are designed to reach deeper into the skin for a more dramatic improvement. This is possible due to the higher concentration and number of active ingredients involved.</p><p>A major difference between products offered by licensed professionals versus drugstores is that medical-grade skincare is under FDA regulation to contain 99.9% pure ingredients and to ensure safety and effectiveness. They are supported by scientific research and are specifically formulated for best results. Because of this fact, those interested in transforming their complexion should seek medical-grade skincare products to achieve optimal results.</p>
